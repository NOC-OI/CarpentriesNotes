    "# Intro to Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "* open a terminal and run `conda --version`\n",
    "* update conda `conda update --name base --channel defaults --yes conda`\n",
    "* initalise `conda init bash` or `conda init powershell`\n",
    "* make a directory for the lesson `cd ~/Desktop ; mkdir introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists ; cd introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "* python can do lots of things, but is only 25mb\n",
    "* but it needs many more libraries to do most non-basic tasks\n",
    "* e.g. scipy, numpy, matplotlib\n",
    "* these libraries are under constant devlopment and new versions come out all the time\n",
    "* environments with different sets of packages or versions of python\n",
    "* could use a VM or another computer, but lots of overhead in that\n",
    "### Problems solved by anaconda\n",
    "Solves common problems of researchers:\n",
    "* an application you want to run needs a different version of python to your current one\n",
    "* code which worked 6 months ago no longer works\n",
    "* it works on your machine but nobody else's\n",
    "* different results on different computers\n",
    "### What it lets us do\n",
    "* environment management system allows different software in different environments.\n",
    "* export environment definitions to other computers/people\n",
    "* allows you to install without admin privileges\n",
    "* python also has virtualenv, pipenv, venv etc\n",
    "### Package management\n",
    "* can identify and install compatible software and dependencies\n",
    "* handle package updates\n",
    "* linux users might be familiar with apt, yum, dnf etc or Mac users with homebrew. \n",
    "* python packages can also be installed with pip, but conda manages more than just python.\n",
    "* installing packages system wide can make it hard to work out what is required for a specific project, impossible to install multiple versions, updates break things, hard to track what is installed.\n",
    "### Exercise: benefits of installing separate software\n",
    "### Conda\n",
    "* open source package manager\n",
    "* create/save/load/switch envs\n",
    "* created for python, but works for other things\n",
    "* conda is a package manager and environment manager\n",
    "* miniconda is conda with python and some base packages included\n",
    "* anaconda is conda with a full distribution of packages including jupyter lab, numpy, matplotlib, conda navigator gui etc.\n",
    "### Why conda?\n",
    "* prebuilt packages, somebody else has done the hard work\n",
    "* cross platform\n",
    "* works with pip\n",
    "* good source of common science packages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap \n",
    "* Conda is a platform agnostic, open source package and environment management system.\n",
    "* Using a package and environment management tool facilitates portability and reproducibility of (data) science workflows.\n",
    "* Conda solves both the package and environment management problems and targets multiple programming languages. Other open source tools solve either one or the other, or target only a particular programming language.\n",
    "* Anaconda is not only for Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "* create directory if not already done\n",
    "* environments contain collections of packages\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create --name python3-env python`\n",
    "`conda create --name python36-env python=3.6`\n",
    "\n",
    "* always specify version numbers\n",
    "* use conda search $PACKAGE_NAME to find packages\n",
    "`conda search scikit-learn`\n",
    "\n",
    "* specify multiple version numbers\n",
    "* this can take a while to resolve\n",
    "`conda create --name basic-scipy-env ipython=7.13 matplotlib=3.1 numpy=1.18 scipy=1.4`\n",
    "### Exercise: creating a new environment\n",
    "### Activating an env\n",
    "* adds entries of all packages to the path\n",
    "* runs any activation scripts, might set other environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda activate basic-scipy-env`\n",
    "* prompt should change\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decativating an env\n",
    "`conda deactivate`\n",
    "\n",
    "* get back to base env with `conda activate` \n",
    "### Activate an existing env by name and deactivate an env exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install package into an existing env\n",
    "\n",
    "* conda install command\n",
    "* optional version number\n",
    "`conda activate basic-scipy-env`\n",
    "`conda install numba`\n",
    "`conda install scikit-learn=0.22`\n",
    "* freeze packages to prevent them being updated, --freeze-installed, might cause older versions to be installed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing a package into a specific env exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where do conda envs live\n",
    "* homedir/envs\n",
    "* can be specified with `conda create --prefix ./env ipython=7.13 matplotlib=3.1 pandas=1.0 python=3.6`\n",
    "* activate with `conda activate ./env`\n",
    "* put envs in a sub directory in your project folder, makes it self contained and easy to find\n",
    "* create a directory called env by convention\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a new env as subdir exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "* drawbacks of making dirs: conda can't find them with --name, you need to pass --prefix + full path instead.\n",
    "* prompt will show full path, this can get very long\n",
    "* `conda config --set env_prompt '({name})'`\n",
    "* will edit ~/.condarc \n",
    "\n",
    "### activate an existing env by path exercise\n",
    "### conda can create R envs too exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "### Listing exist envs\n",
    "`conda env list`\n",
    "* list env contents\n",
    "`conda list --name basic-scipy-env`\n",
    "* of if we used a prefix\n",
    "`conda list --prefix /path/to/conda-env`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleting envs\n",
    "`conda k --name my-first-conda-env --all`\n",
    "or\n",
    "`conda remove --prefix /path/to/conda/env --all`k\n",
